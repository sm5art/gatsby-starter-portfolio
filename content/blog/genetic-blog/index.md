# Introduction

When approaching a machine learning problem, a clear definition is key. Next, mathematical modeling and algorithmic optimization come into play to fine-tune the model's parameters. In this blog, we'll delve into one specific type of unsupervised learning: **genetic algorithms**. Introduced by John Holland in 1960, inspired by Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, these algorithms have been gaining traction in various fields such as quant finance and various control theory objectives like robotics and also science fields like medicine/and materials. Here, we'll explore how a genetic algorithm can be applied to the classic game of Pong, allowing us to play it unsupervised. In this post, we'll first set the context for our problem and then dive into the implementation details later on. This blog assumes some basic knowledge of linear algebra and some basic python programming knowledge.

# The Problem (The Environment)

When I was in college my friend came to me with a really cool project he was working on: he recreated the classic game of pong in python and was showing me how you can have two players playing simultaneously using different keys on the keyboard. He asked me if its possible to recreate an AI in his game and I set out to explore the potential solutions. I thought of a few ideas, you could try to just create a pretty simple program that would tell the opponent paddle to move up and down based on the position of the ball relative to the paddle and figure out the correct parameters but I set out to explore more potential solutions here using genetic algorithms.

![Pong game](./pong.jpg)

The environment of the game of pong consists of two concepts: the state of the game and the actions that either player can take in the game. The state of the game of pong is outlayed by the display shown the the user the 1280x720 output which is only one valued here since the game is mostly unichannel/unicollor, we can assume a pretty simple game space for the game state. But even here we can abstract more features out of this by knowing that we have memory access to the balls position and players position, we can abstract even more simple features than the game screen which allow for more robust and quicker learning. The actions that could be taken in the game are represented by the mainly three actions/controls the player has at any time while playing the game: moving up, moving down, doing nothing.

# Modeling The Problem

In this section we are solving the sub-problem of coming up with the inputs and outputs of our model such that we get a model that will suit our specific task of figuring out when to move a pong paddle up or down in relation to the game state.

**The problem** - Designing a function that takes any given information from the game state that outputs the ideal action. Mathematically what this model looks like is a function with a domain (input values) that spans the game state and a range (output values) that spans the possible actions.

## How do we model?

A model has input features and outputs which are designed based on what the problem specifies. We will be using linear algebra to drive the "unknown" part of this model.

```
i.e. y = Ax+B
x - game state
y - outputs
A, B - unknown
```

## The game state (inputs)

Since the pong game is written in python we have direct memory access to the ball and paddle speed and direction in the x/y direction which we will be using in the engineering of the inputs/game state. The game state will change every frame of the game which will plug into the model to decide the optimal output. The inputs are normalized to reduce weight explosions when optimizing.
*Note: Max Speed and Screen Height are constants defined in the code and could be changed*

![The inputs](./inputs.png)

This image is showing us the inputs I have chosen to engineer in to this model from the game state, the v<sub>y</sub>, v<sub>x</sub> variables are retrieved by taking the speeds that are being used actively in the frame in the game shown in the code here. *The code is available for download above and [here](https://github.com/sm5art/genetic-pong) on github so you can run the pretrained version on your own computer or run the training yourself*



ball.py
```
class Ball(object):
	
	def __init__(self, screen,x,y,size,x_speed,y_speed, color):
		
		self.screen = screen
		self.x = x
		self.y = y
		self.size = size
		self.x_speed = x_speed
		self.y_speed = y_speed
		self.color = color

	def move(self):
		self.x+=self.x_speed
		self.y+=self.y_speed
		if (self.y <= 0 and self.y_speed < 0):
			self.y_speed = -self.y_speed
		elif (self.y+self.size >= HEIGHT and self.y_speed > 0):
			self.y_speed = -self.y_speed
		self._draw()

	def _draw(self):
		pygame.draw.rect(self.screen, self.color,[self.x,self.y,self.size,self.size])
```
Similiar with the paddle we can get the variables through the code/memory during gameplay like this.



paddle_object.py
```
class paddle(object):

    def __init__(self,screen,x,y,length,width,player,speed,weights=None):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.player = player
        self.screen = screen
        self.speed = speed
        if weights is not None:
            self.weights = np.array(weights)
            self.A, self.B, self.C, self.D = format_weight_array(self.weights)
        else:
            weights = np.array([1, 1, 1, 1, 1])
        self.config = {'one': {'w': pygame.K_i, 's': pygame.K_k}, 'two': {'w':pygame.K_w, 's':pygame.K_s }}

    def _draw(self, color=(255,255,255)):
        pygame.draw.rect(self.screen,color,[self.x,self.y,self.width,self.length])

    def _move_down(self, multiplier=1):
        if self.y+self.length<=HEIGHT:
            self.y += multiplier*self.speed
        
    def _move_up(self, multiplier=1):
        if self.y >= 0:
            self.y -= multiplier*self.speed
```


## The actions (outputs)

The outputs for **the problem** is the pong paddle's direction of action.

![The outputs](./outputs.png)
Here we have a pretty simple output space which is represented by one scalar value y. If the y value is above a specified threshold constant called c the pong paddle will be coded to move up in the game against the input space. If the y value is below this specified constant c the pong paddle will be programmed to move down. Otherwise in the range between these values just leave the paddle doing nothing for that frame.

paddle_object.py
```
class paddle(object):
    ....
    def move_kb(self, color=(255,255,255)):
        keys = pygame.key.get_pressed()
        if keys[self.config[self.player]['w']]:
            self._move_up()
        elif keys[self.config[self.player]['s']]:
            self._move_down()
        self._draw(color=color)

    def move_ai(self, ball):
        X = prepare_features(ball.x_speed, ball.y_speed, ball.y, self.y)
        decision = nn(self.A, self.B, self.C, self.D, X)
        if decision > 0.1:
            self._move_up()
        elif decision < -0.1:
            self._move_down()
        self._draw()
```

## Algebra of a Neural Network

I used a simple neural network with one set of hidden layers to model the behavior of the paddle.
![The outputs](./model.png)
Dimensions of variables

*Note: hidden layers is a constant that is chosen and can be changed to improve performance or add more complexity/parameters to the model*

```
x: 4x1 (game state/domain)
y: 1x1  (actions/range)
A: # hidden layers x 4 (unknown weights)
B: # hidden layers x 1 (unknown bias)
C: 1 x # hidden layers (unknown weights)
D: 1x1 (unknown bias)
```

This is the model I engineered after a few attempts including linear regression. The weights and bias A, B, C, D are all unknown and will be optimized for in the next section of the blog.

Here is the model code

model.py
```
import numpy as np
from genetic import Gene

input_size = Gene.input_size
hidden_size = Gene.hidden_size

def forward_model(A, x, C):
    return np.tanh(np.dot(A, x)+C)



def nn(A, B, C, D, x):
    return np.tanh(np.dot(C, np.tanh(np.matmul(A, x) + B)) + D)


def format_weight_array(array):
    A = np.array(array[:hidden_size*input_size]).reshape((hidden_size, input_size))
    B = np.array(array[hidden_size*input_size:hidden_size*(input_size+1)])
    C = np.array(array[hidden_size*(input_size+1):hidden_size*(input_size+2)])
    D = np.array(array[hidden_size*(input_size+2)])
    return A, B, C, D
```

# The Genetic Algorithim

## Why is this even necessary?

As I mentioned in the previous section, we have 4 weights and bias terms that we need to optimize for yet we don't have a labeled data set that represents what a pong player should do depending on these inputs. This will require the usage of an unsupervised learning algorithim which will evaluate the progress of learning through a different heuristic.

## What is a chromosome (genetic algorithim)?

## Contents

* A chromosome which expresses a possible solution to the problem as a string
* A fitness function which takes a chromosome as input and returns a higher value for better solution(much more likely to reproduce)
* A population which is just a set of many chromosomes
* A selection method which determines how parents are selected for breeding from the population
* A crossover operation which determines how parents combine to produce offspring
* A mutation operation which determines how random deviations manifest themselves

## What's the heurstic that drives you to a solution?

Genetic algorithims rely on a fitness heurstic which is a function that takes a chromosome and returns a higher value for a better performing solution.

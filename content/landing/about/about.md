# About me

I'm a software engineer based out of **San Francisco, CA** who enjoys studying algorithms. I recently graduated from the **University of Washington** in Seattle, WA studying Applied Physics with a Bachelors degree and have had industry experience working as a Python/Javascript engineer at various startups/technology companies and hedge funds. Most recently I was a full stack engineer at **Autodesk** working on User Profile APIs and infrastructure. I currently work on a blog posting about algorithm/AI concepts and always working on various projects to write more about. I am constantly curious in how technology and intersections of various related fields can continue to be applied to various scientific/quantitative/technological problems in life to better improve conditions and improve learning for all.

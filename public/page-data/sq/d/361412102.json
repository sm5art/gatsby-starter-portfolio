I recently graduated from the <strong>University of Washington</strong> in Seattle, WA studying Applied Physics with a Bachelors degree and have had industry experience working as a Python/Javascript engineer at various startups/technology companies and hedge funds. Most recently I was a full stack engineer at <strong>Autodesk</strong> working on User Profile APIs and infrastructure. I currently work on a blog posting about algorithm/AI concepts and always working on various projects to write more about. I am constantly curious in how technology and intersections of various related fields can continue to be applied to various scientific/quantitative/technological problems in life to better improve conditions and improve learning for all.</p>\n<h2>Technologies i’ve been working with</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Typescript/React/redux</li>\n<li>python</li>\n<li>pytorch</li>\n<li>langchain</li>\n<li>postgres</li>\n<li>DuckDB</li>\n<li>ollama</li>\n<li>huggingface</li>\n<li>redis</li>\n<li>mongoDB</li>\n<li>tensorflow</li>\n<li>serverless (AWS Lambda)</li>\n</ul>"}}}
